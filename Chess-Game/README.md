/*
 * Project Title:
 * - Super Chess
 * Description:
 * This program is a somewhat faithful recreation of chess. It allows two
 * people to play a full game against each other. It provides a graphical
 * representation of the board, as well as the ability to check that every
 * move is legal and determine when each king is in check.
 *
 * Developers:
 * - William Leithauser - leithawj@mail.uc.edu
 * - Rajdeep Bandopadhyay - bandoprp@mail.uc.edu
 *
 * Help Received:
 * - No help received from people
 * - Credit to stackoverflow for helping us debug the program
 *
 * Special Instructions:
 * - Compile using "g++ chess.cpp board.cpp game.cpp"
 * 
 * NOTE: All function documentation has been done in header files. This
 * allows a separation of the documentation from the implementation.
 *
 * Developer comments: 
 * William Leithauser:
 * I wrote all of chess.cpp and the majority of game.cpp and board.h. In
 * addition, I assisted with many of the functions in board.cpp including the
 * move validity checker and the check checker. I also tested the program and
 * put together the final copy. I would say that the main thing I learned from
 * this process was how to structure a somewhat longer program using classes
 * and many functions. As you can probably see, we did not do the best job of
 * structuring the program. However, I have learned a lot from my mistakes and
 * now I can structure more effectively in the future.
 * 
 * Rajdeep Bandopadhyay:
 * I wrote all the header files, along with the major parts of board.cpp and 
 * wrote the full front-end UI for the whole program, I also assisted with the
 * case definitions for the check functuion and the castle function. I learned
 * a lot while working on this project, it was really rewarding. Although we did
 * not do a perfect job, and I would say that it was because of the limited time 
 * we had for the project, I also learned to work with classes and header files too.

Comments:
There is some changes made after due date [at April 27, 4:01PM], 
that was because one of our teammate forgot to push the final changes 
to the git repository the last time.
Thank you, please don't deduct points for that. There is a
lot^10^100^100 /gogolplex/ of hardwork been put into making
of this project.

Comments:
There is some changes made after due date [at April 27, 4:01PM], 
that was because one of our teammate forgot to push the final changes 
to the git repository the last time.
Thank you, please don't deduct points for that. There is a
lot^10^100^100 /gogolplex/ of hardwork been put into making
of this project.
